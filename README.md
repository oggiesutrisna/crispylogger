Crispy Logger is the non-safe keylogger made from python
of course, this is not a open source, if you wanted to try it, just clone or download via zip, and see the dist folder and double click main.py
if you don't see something, check on your taskmanager.

this project doesn't finish yet, i've trying to write some code for screenshot every 5 minutes and send it via email.
